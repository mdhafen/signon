PHP Modules required for this to work:

php-ldap
php-openssl
php-google-api-php-client
php-imap

Copy the lib/config_sample.phpm file to lib/config.phpm and edit
lib/config.phpm with settings for the site title, secure phrase, and
LDAP settings.  The roles mapping in that file maps members of an LDAP group
to security roles for access to the 'Manage Users' section.

Also edit the inc/google.phpm file to make sure the correct settings
are in that file for Google api access, a Twilio account, the LDAP base,
and the various location to LDAP mappings.  And you will need to put the
Google api private key file in the same directory and include the  filename.

You will need to setup a database for attribute history, owned passwords,
and user locks.
