PHP Modules required for this to work:

php5-ldap
php-mcrypt?
php-xml-serializer
php-google-api-php-client
php5-imap

And make sure the imap module is getting loaded.

Edit lib/config.phpm with settings for the site title, secure phrase, and
LDAP settings.  The roles mapping in that file maps members of an LDAP group
to security roles for access to the 'Manage Users' section.

Also edit the inc/google.phpm file to make sure the correct settings
are in that file for api access, a GoogleVoice account, the LDAP base,
and the various location to LDAP base mappings.  And you will need to
put the private key file in the same directory and include the filename.
